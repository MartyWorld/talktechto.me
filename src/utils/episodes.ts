              <p>California has a lofty goal of banning the sale of all combustion-engine passenger vehicles by 2035  in the name of reducing its level of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            </li>

              <p>Before the ultimate ban, 35% of newly sold vehicles must utilize renewable energy by 2026, and 68% by 2030. Currently, EVs account for 16% of new car sales in the state.</p>

              <p>Roche claims that they "used [litigation services] as a strategic weapon to help Ava Labs" in one of the videos.

            <li>
              <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always use <strong>strong passwords and a password manager</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>All passwords should be created with these principles in mind:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Long-</strong> All of your passwords should be at least 12 characters long.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unique-</strong> Never reuse passwords. Every account should have its own unique password.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Complex-</strong> Each unique password should combine upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters (like >,!?).</p></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Don‚Äôt sleep on password managers. They‚Äôre safe and can help you organize your passwords in one place, so ditch the notebook! Some options are:</p>
              <ul>

              <p>Nikolai Mushegian (pronounced moo-she-gyan), a 29 y.o technical co-founder of MakerDAO (DAI stablecoin), the biggest decentralized finance protocol, and contributor to numerous crypto projects was found dead in San Juan, Puerto Rico Friday, Oct. 28.</p>

            <li>
              <p>According to a press release, he was dragged by water currents near Condado Beach, which is known for its dangerous currents that have caused several deaths.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Beach patrol recovered his body just hours after he posted a chilling tweet that read: <strong>‚ÄúCIA and Mossad (pronounced moe-sod) and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and Caribbean islands.
