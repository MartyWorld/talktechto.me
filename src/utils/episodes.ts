              <p>Gen Z desires networking and mentorship.

            Wall Street Journal blasts Elon Musk for creeping with Google co-founder‚Äôs wife

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>According to a shocking report published on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal, Elon Musk allegedly had a brief hookup with the wife of Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, last fall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>This allegedly led to Sergey Brin‚Äôs filing for divorce and the breakup of the long-standing friendship between the two tech billionaires.</p>

            <li>
              <p>
              Messy Musky called it a ‚Äúhit piece." He shared a selfie with Sergey on Twitter and even said they partied together the night before and it was ‚Äúpositive vibes.‚Äù The allegations have since been denied by Sergey's soon-to-be ex-wife, Nicole Shanahan.

              <p>This is the first case, that we know of, of insider trading in the cryptocurrency sector. While working at Coinbase, these guys sold information to third parties and made investments in cryptocurrencies before they were listed on the exchange using their insider knowledge.</p>

              <p>Elon Musk, better known on the show as "Messy Musky," has been at odds with Twitter since he pulled out of the $44 billion deal to acquire the site and was sued to hold him to it.</p>

            <li>
              <p>A new "Termination Letter" was submitted by Musk's attorneys to the SEC, and they are now attempting a different strategy: Mention Peiter "Mudge" Zatko, a Twitter whistleblower.</p>

              <p>Before the ultimate ban, 35% of newly sold vehicles must utilize renewable energy by 2026, and 68% by 2030. Currently, EVs account for 16% of new car sales in the state.</p>

              <p>On Tuesday, September 6th, District Attorney George Gascon confirmed that 16 suspects had been charged in a sophisticated EBT fraud scheme.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>According to the criminal complaint, the group allegedly stole cardholders' private EBT account information, duplicated real EBT cards using that information, and then used the phony EBT cards to make ATM withdrawals from the accounts. Later, when the actual cardholders went to withdraw money, they discovered that their accounts were empty.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>16 people were apprehended by the Southern California High Tech Task Force, who also seized $130k in cash and over 300 counterfeit EBT cards with an estimated $400k.</p>
            </li>

              <p>According to the DA‚Äôs Office, all of the defendants entered not guilty pleas and were later freed under electronic monitoring.</p>

              <p>Musk's legal team issued a subpoena to the Twitter co-founder, who was due to be questioned under oath on Tuesday, Sept. 20, via Zoom.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dorsey left Twitter as CEO last November and stayed on the board until late May, only one month after the firm announced an agreement to sell to Musk for $54.20 per share.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Parag Agrawal has since taken over for Dorsey. Agrawal and Twitter have consistently claimed that they informed the SEC that less than 5% of their users are fake and that Musk has no grounds to terminate the agreement. According to Twitter, Musk wants to back out of the deal because it no longer serves his interests.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>After several decades of voicing Darth Vader in the Star Wars saga, legendary actor James Earl Jones has announced his retirement, but his voice will live on through AI.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Jones who is 91, has formally signed off on archival voice recordings, a system being used by rookie filmmakers who want to use AI to reproduce Jones' youthful voice from prior films in the franchise.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Respeecher, a Ukrainian firm that uses AI software, will recreate new dialogues by reusing existing voice recordings.</p>

              <p>A TikTok user named Jon (@primetimejon) goes viral after alleging that his employer, T-Mobile, ordered him to stop creating TikToks even though he was doing so off the clock and promoting the brand positively.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Jon stated, ‚ÄúAll I wanted to do was work with T-Mobile corporate and make videos for them, and work with the social media team and move up.‚Äù He further explained, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I wanted to do, was just cheer on T-Mobile.‚Äù</p>
            </li>

              <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always enable <strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong>, also known as 2-factor authentication, a security measure requiring anyone logging into an account to go through a two-step verification process.</p>

            <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/online-safety-privacy-basics/passwords-securing-accounts/"><u>#BeCyberSmart tip of the week</u></a>

              <p>"Because it's Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I'll be sharing easy tips you can start applying right away to improve your online safety in these digital streets."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always use <strong>strong passwords and a password manager</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>All passwords should be created with these principles in mind:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Long-</strong> All of your passwords should be at least 12 characters long.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Unique-</strong> Never reuse passwords. Every account should have its own unique password.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Complex-</strong> Each unique password should combine upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters (like >,!?).</p></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Don‚Äôt sleep on password managers. They‚Äôre safe and can help you organize your passwords in one place, so ditch the notebook! Some options are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>1Password</p></li>
                <li><p>Bitwarden</p></li>

              <p><strong>Tip:</strong> One of the easiest things you can do is <strong>update your software and apps</strong> to keep your information secure.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Update often -</strong> Don‚Äôt delay updates when they become available. Updates fix software issues and provide new security patches where hackers might try to get in.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Get it from the source</strong> only download your software updates from the company that created it. (unlicensed versions can contain malware).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Make it automatic -</strong> When possible select the option to update your software automatically.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Watch for fakes!</strong> Maybe you've encountered pop-up windows when visiting a website that prompts you to download something or fill out a form? These are fake and should be ignored.</p></li>

            <li><p>If you‚Äôre not an HBCU student you can search for cybersecurity meetups in your area and join online groups like Blacks In Cybersecurity.
